        <h2>1. What is Essence Crown?</h2>
        <p>Essence Crown: Shard Wars is a tactical trading card game where each player leads a Deity and commands Shards, Avatars, and powerful Techniques. You channel KL (Kundalini) energy into Essence, build up your Shard network, and break through your opponent’s defenses. When their Deity falls, you claim the Crown.</p>

        <h2>Components &amp; Zones</h2>
        <p>Your side of the board has:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Deity Zone – Your chosen Deity card lives here. If your Deity runs out of life/Essence, you lose.</li>
          <li>Shard Lanes – 3–5 lanes in front of your Deity where you place Shard and Avatar cards. These lanes are where most combat happens.</li>
          <li>Hand – The cards you currently hold and can play.</li>
          <li>Deck – Your face-down stack of cards. You draw from here.</li>
          <li>Grave / Aftershard – Where used, destroyed, or sacrificed cards go.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="learn-card">
        <h2>Card Types</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Deity – Your leader. Gives you starting life/Essence and a passive identity for your deck. Some Deities have special abilities that shape your whole strategy.</li>
          <li>Shard – The “land” of Essence Crown. Shards generate Essence or modify how you channel KL energy. You usually play Shards early to fuel your bigger plays.</li>
          <li>Avatar / Unit – Your fighters on the Shard lanes. They attack, block, and carry your combat power. Most have:</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="sub-list">
          <li>Power – How much damage they deal in combat.</li>
          <li>Toughness / Guard – How much damage they can take before being destroyed.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Technique / Spell – One-time effects. They can buff your Avatars, damage enemy units, draw cards, or manipulate Shards and Essence.</li>
          <li>Relic / Field (if used in this build) – Ongoing effects that sit on the field and warp the rules in your favor.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each card also has:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Essence Cost – How much Essence you need to pay to play it.</li>
          <li>Optional keywords like Channel, Awaken, or Overload that give it special rules.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="learn-card">
        <h2>Resources: KL, Essence, and Costs</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>KL (Kundalini) is your raw spiritual power.</li>
          <li>Essence is the energy you actually spend to play cards.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Basic idea:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>At the start of your turn, your KL/Essence refreshes.</li>
          <li>Shards and abilities tell you how much Essence you can use.</li>
          <li>You pay Essence Costs to play cards. When you pay, that Essence is spent until it refreshes or returns as defined by the engine.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Win</h2>
        <p>Reduce your opponent’s Deity to 0 life/Essence (or whatever your client displays as Deity health). Some advanced cards may add alternate win conditions, but this is the core.</p>

        <h2>First Game Setup (Beginner Mode)</h2>
        <ul>

          <li>Shuffle and draw your opening hand.</li>
          <li>Use the in-game labels to identify Deity zone, Shard lanes, hand, and deck.</li>
          <li>Early turns: play 1 Shard per turn (if possible), then play Avatars, then start attacking.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once comfortable, start mixing in Techniques, trying new Deities, and exploring advanced modes.</p>
